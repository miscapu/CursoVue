    <h1>Why Vue.js?</h1>
        <p>
            With Vue.js I can build a SPA(Single Page Application).
            Another option to is to go with a framework that let's
            you start small and make choices for your app as the need
            arises.
            Vue.js is called a progressive framework y its creators.
            This is because it allows you to start building your app
            with minial effort as the core Vue.js library focuses only
            on the view layer.
            Over time as the requirements grow, you can adapt additional
            libraries for functionality.
            The idea of adding features to the app you are creating over
            time doesn't limit the use of more complex development tools.

            Need to add a router? No problem; use the Vue-Router a third
            party option, or roll your own.
            Looking to manage in memory state? You can use a Plain Old
            JavaScript Object, a store pattern, or the Vue.js specific
            Vuex. By now you get the idea.

            This all probably makes Vue.js sound complicated, but it's not.
            In fact, one of the reasons that developers often say they choose
            Vue.js is because of how easy it is to get started.
            With little overhead, a developer can get to work and produce
            results without the added complexity of other populae frameworks.
            And this ease of beginning doesn't limit the complexity of the app
            you can build, as Vue.js can scale in complexity with your project's
            requirements.

        One of the best parts of using Vue.js is that it requires little overhead
        to get started. Add a script tag referencing the Content Delivery Network(CDN)
        for the library to your page and you are ready to get going!
        Let's take a quick look at what it requires to get started.
        We will start with a pretty empty.
