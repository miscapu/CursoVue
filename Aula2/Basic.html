<h1>The Basics</h1>
    <p>Before we can get too far into understanding Vue, we need
        to cover a few things.
        We start off by learning what options we have when creating an
        instance o Vue. After we have an understanding of what we can
        provide Vue to make it suit our needs, we look at how at how can start
        binding it to HTML, with a look at the templating syntax.
    </p>
    <h2>Vue options</h2>
    <p>
        Before we get too far, we shoould learn more about the options
        that are available when creating a Vue instance.
        In Class 1, we created an instance by using the bare minimum of options
        to get Vue to render the <strong>data</strong> and the <strong>el</strong>
        property on the page in order to specify when the Vue instance should be
        and what data it would have access to.
    </p>
    <h2>El Property</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>el</strong> property we talked about allows us to specify
        where our Vue instance will mount on the page. The value you provide
        can be a string that is a CSS selector (such as #app), as shown in example before.
    </p>
    <h2>Template</h2>
    <p>
        All this talk about Vue using a template means we should probably cover how to pass
        a template in as part of the options object. When you're creating a new Vue instance,
        one of the options you can provide as a property is template.
        The template string is used by Vue to generate the DOM it will be placing in the
        web page in place of the element that was selected with the <strong>el</strong> option.
        It must have one root element. This will replace anything that is inside the element
        that the instance of Vue gets mounted to.
    </p>

    <p>One point to keep in mind is that the element you
    target to use as a template should be placed before you app
    are declared.
    </p>

    <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>We use the data property to tell our instance what shape
        our data will resemble. If there is something we want to be
        able to bind to in our Vue instance, we need to include in the data
        before we create our Vue instance
        </p>
        <p>
            When a new Vue instance is created, it adds all the properties of data
            to a eactive system. The vue reactive system monitors the properties of the
            data object for changes and updates the view to "react" to these change.
            This means we cannot add new data to be monitored by Vue's system after the
            application starts. If, at the time you create your Vue instance, you don't know
            what the values of your data properties will be, define them with the names
            and give them a value of an empty string--", null ou undefined. Don't use
            the empty {}, as that will render the stringified JSON of the empty oject.
            Say your HTML looked like, with 3 data properties emptyObject, emptyString
            and nullProperty, and null assigned accordingly in the app.
